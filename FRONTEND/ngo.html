            <p><strong>3) Khalsa Aid</strong> International is a UK-based humanitarian relief charity (Registered Charity Number: 1163294) providing support around the world to victims of natural and man-made disasters such as floods, earthquakes, famine and war. Our team is often one of the first on the scene to help distribute food, water, clothing, medical and sanitation supplies. We fund and build semi-permanent shelters, if needed – anything that’s required in those early days to save lives, reduce people’s immediate suffering and help maintain their dignity. The charity was founded by Ravinder (Ravi) Singh, who was struck by the plight of the refugees in Kosovo in 1999. That year also marked the 300th birth anniversary of the Khalsa – an opportunity for the community to reflect on the core teachings of their faith. Ravi saw the footage of the Kosovan refugees on the news and was inspired by one Sikhi ideology in particular – “Sarbat da Bhalla” meaning “well-being for all” – recognizing the humanity in us all and reaching out to those in need, regardless of race, religion, borders.</p>
